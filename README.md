# Pre-trained vs purpose-built models for time series forecasting, Chronos case study
So, the goal is to benchmark Chronos to a handful of models with different architectures. for the implementation, we'll use AutoGluon, a python library that helps with automating the task of selecting, tuning and deploying machine learning models.

you can follow along and execute the python code in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mzaoualim/us_gas_price/blob/c7f9509126e3741c6dd990c8a2e4bb54e57e68ac/notebooks/step_by_step_notebook.ipynb).
